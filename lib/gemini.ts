Interview ETL transforms stakeholder interview transcripts into structured user stories and requirements using AI. It's a 5-step workflow: 1) Define output schema, 2) Upload transcripts, 3) AI processing, 4) Edit user stories, 5) Generate requirements.

Key Capabilities:
- File Support: TXT, DOCX, PDF, Markdown, ZIP (up to 50MB individual, 500MB total)
- AI Processing: Gemini AI with Vertex AI vectorization (2-5 min processing time)
- Output Formats: CSV export for user stories and requirements
- Editing: Full inline editing of extracted data
- Validation: Confidence scoring and quality metrics

Technical Architecture:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with React 18 and TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- AI: Google Gemini API + Vertex AI for embeddings
- Storage: Google Cloud Firestore + Cloud Storage
- Processing: Async worker with Pub/Sub integration

Data Models:
- User Story: id, userStory, stakeholder info, epic, priority, confidence, tags
- Requirement: req_id, requirement, priority_level, req_details, source_story_id
- Construct: name, output_schema, pattern, validation_rules

Best Practices:
- Use structured interview guides with clear stakeholder identification
- Keep output schemas focused but comprehensive
- Review AI extractions and validate confidence scores
- Process interviews in logical batches for better context
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across projects

Common Questions & Answers:
- "How does it work?": 5-step workflow from schema definition to requirements generation
- "What file formats?": TXT, DOCX, PDF, Markdown, ZIP with size limits
- "How long does processing take?": 2-5 minutes depending on file count and size
- "Can I edit the results?": Yes, full inline editing of user stories and requirements
- "What makes this different?": AI-powered extraction with vectorization for context awareness
- "How do I get started?": Click Get Started → Define output structure → Upload transcripts

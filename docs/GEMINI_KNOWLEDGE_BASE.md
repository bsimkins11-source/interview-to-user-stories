# Interview ETL Application - Gemini AI Knowledge Base

## üéØ **Application Overview**

The Interview ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) application is a sophisticated AI-powered platform that transforms stakeholder interview transcripts into structured, actionable requirements. It's designed for product managers, business analysts, and development teams who need to convert qualitative interview data into quantitative, structured outputs.

### **Primary Purpose**
- Transform unstructured interview transcripts into structured user stories

## üîÑ **Core Workflow & Process**

### **Step 1: Define Output Structure (Construct)**
- Users define the schema for their user stories output
- Specify fields like: stakeholder info, user story text, priority, business value, acceptance criteria
- Create pattern templates for consistent formatting
- Set validation rules and default values

**Technical Details:**
- Constructs are stored as JSON schemas with field definitions
- Each field has a name, type, description, and validation rules
- Pattern templates use a simple syntax for dynamic content generation
- Supports custom field types and nested structures

### **Step 2: Upload Interview Transcripts**
- Accepts multiple file formats: TXT, DOCX, PDF, Markdown, ZIP
- Supports folder imports from cloud storage (Google Drive, SharePoint)
- Handles batch processing of multiple interviews
- Validates file integrity and content structure

**Technical Details:**
- File size limits: Individual files up to 50MB, total batch up to 500MB
- Automatic text extraction from various formats
- Content validation and preprocessing
- Metadata extraction (speaker identification, timestamps)

### **Step 3: AI Processing & Extraction**
- Gemini AI processes transcripts with full context awareness
- Uses Vertex AI vectorization for semantic understanding
- Extracts user stories based on defined schema
- Applies business logic and validation rules

**Technical Details:**
- Processing time: 2-5 minutes for typical batches
- Vector embeddings capture semantic meaning and relationships
- Cross-reference analysis across multiple interviews
- Confidence scoring for each extracted element
- Context-aware field mapping based on schema

### **Step 4: Download & Review Results**
- Generate structured CSV outputs
- Provide confidence scores and quality metrics
- Enable result validation and review
- Support multiple export formats

### **Step 5: Edit User Stories**

# Gemini AI Prompt Context - Interview ETL Application

## **Application Purpose**
Interview ETL transforms stakeholder interview transcripts into structured user stories and requirements using AI. It's a 5-step workflow: 1) Define output schema, 2) Upload transcripts, 3) AI processing, 4) Edit user stories, 5) Generate requirements.

## **Current User Context**
- **Step**: {currentStep}
- **Construct**: {constructName} with {fieldCount} fields
- **Transcripts**: {transcriptCount} files uploaded
- **User Stories**: {storyCount} extracted
- **Requirements**: {requirementCount} generated

## **Key Capabilities**
- **File Support**: TXT, DOCX, PDF, Markdown, ZIP (up to 50MB individual, 500MB total)
- **AI Processing**: Gemini AI with Vertex AI vectorization (2-5 min processing time)
- **Output Formats**: CSV export for user stories and requirements
- **Editing**: Full inline editing of extracted data
- **Validation**: Confidence scoring and quality metrics

## **Technical Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18 and TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- **AI**: Google Gemini API + Vertex AI for embeddings
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Firestore + Cloud Storage
- **Processing**: Async worker with Pub/Sub integration

## **Data Models**
**User Story**: id, userStory, stakeholder info, epic, priority, confidence, tags
**Requirement**: req_id, requirement, priority_level, req_details, source_story_id
**Construct**: name, output_schema, pattern, validation_rules
